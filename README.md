# Walkability-Kalamazoo-Dallas

I practice data analysis by comparing Walkability in Kalamazoo and Dallas County using python and ArcGis

Data set used: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index1

The PDF "Comparison of Kalamazoo and Dallas County Walkability" contains some of the findings from working with this data set
